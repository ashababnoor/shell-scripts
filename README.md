## Introduction

In this repository, you will find a collection of stable shell scripts that I have developed over time. These scripts are designed to perform various tasks and automate certain processes in my personal projects.

## Scripts

Here is a list of the shell scripts available in this repository:

- [gitit](./scripts/gitit.sh)
- [colors](./scripts/colors.sh)

Feel free to explore the scripts and use them for your own personal projects.

## Usage

To use any of the scripts in this repository, simply clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to the desired script's directory. Then, you can execute the script using the appropriate command.

For example, to run `script1.sh`, you can use the following command:
```bash
cd scripts
source gitit.sh
```
This will enable three commands
- `gitit`
- `gpush`
- `gpull`

Run `gitit --help` to get help message
